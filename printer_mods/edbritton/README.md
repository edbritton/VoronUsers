Flush bowden rear leg for V0
============================

This replaces the rear-right leg of the V0, removing the protruding bowen mount with a hole which aims directly behind the rear panel.

* Creates a slimmer look.
* Avoids knocking, and spinning, the leg when relocating the portable printer.
* Feeds more directly behind the rear panel.
* Extremely easy to install.

Considerations
--------------

I chose to trim my bowden tubing at an angle so filament more easily travels through the openning.
